## Introduction
In this repo, I present an R Markdown file that I created after completing a lesson in UDacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
We explore two data sets related to the Health sector. This submission included the R code used.

## The Data
In this data analysis, I use data available on GapMinder's data sets web page. Specifically, I focused on _GDP/capita (US$, inflation-adjusted)_ sourced from the World Bank (WB) and the _Prevalence of HIV among adults aged 15â€“49 (%)_ sourced from Wolrd Health Organisation (WHO).
