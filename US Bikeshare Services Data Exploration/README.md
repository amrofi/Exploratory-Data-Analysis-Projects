## US-Bikeshare-Services-Data---Exploration-in-Python
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and wrote code to compute descriptive statistics. The analysis and findings were documents in a Jupyter Notebook.
